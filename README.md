## Overview

Climate conditions have been dramatically changing around the world during the past 10 years and continue to do so at an alarming rate. In particular, extreme weather events have increased in both severity and frequency. This is why ClimateWins, a European non-profit, aims to develop new ways to predict weather conditions using machine-learning techniques. 
The first step of this project is to train selected machine-learning algorithms on existing climate data to determine which one is best suited for the task.
ClimateWins is a fictional organization created for the purpose of this project. 

## Data Sources

The data used comes from the European Climate Assessment and Data Set project and consists of daily weather observations, such as mean/minimum/maximum temperature, wind speed and cloud cover, from 18 weather stations across Europe. 
Results from a fictional survey conducted in 16 of these locations about the weather each day are also used alongside the ECAD data.

## Folders 

data: contains original ECAD climate data set and the Pleasant Weather survey data. Scaled weather data was too large to upload.
scripts: contains python scripts used to clean, scale and optimize data, as well as to run the ML algorithms.
documents: contains written observations and analyses along with accompanying visuals.
